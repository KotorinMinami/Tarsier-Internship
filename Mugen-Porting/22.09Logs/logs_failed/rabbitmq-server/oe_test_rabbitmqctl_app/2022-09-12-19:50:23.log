Shutting down RabbitMQ node rabbit@openEuler-riscv64 running at PID 1661
Error: unable to perform an operation on node 'rabbit@openEuler-riscv64'. Please see diagnostics information and suggestions below.

Most common reasons for this are:

 * Target node is unreachable (e.g. due to hostname resolution, TCP connection or firewall issues)
 * CLI tool fails to authenticate with the server (e.g. due to CLI tool's Erlang cookie not matching that of the server)
 * Target node is not running

In addition to the diagnostics info below:

 * See the CLI, clustering and networking guides on https://rabbitmq.com/documentation.html to learn more
 * Consult server logs on node rabbit@openEuler-riscv64
 * If target node is configured to use long node names, don't forget to use --longnames with CLI tools

   ntfssecaudit [-v] volume file
	display the security parameters of file
   ntfssecaudit -r[v] volume directory
	display the security parameters of files in directory
   ntfssecaudit -b[v] volume directory
        backup the security parameters of files in directory
   ntfssecaudit -s[ev] volume [backupfile]
        set the security parameters as indicated in backup file
        with -e also set extra parameters (Windows attrib)
   ntfssecaudit volume perms file
	set the security parameters of file to perms

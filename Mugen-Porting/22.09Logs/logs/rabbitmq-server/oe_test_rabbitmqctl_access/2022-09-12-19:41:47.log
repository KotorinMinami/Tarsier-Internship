Error: unable to perform an operation on node 'rabbit@openEuler-riscv64'. Please see diagnostics information and suggestions below.

Most common reasons for this are:

 * Target node is unreachable (e.g. due to hostname resolution, TCP connection or firewall issues)
 * CLI tool fails to authenticate with the server (e.g. due to CLI tool's Erlang cookie not matching that of the server)
 * Target node is not running

In addition to the diagnostics info below:

 * See the CLI, clustering and networking guides on https://rabbitmq.com/documentation.html to learn more
 * Consult server logs on node rabbit@openEuler-riscv64
 * If target node is configured to use long node names, don't forget to use --longnames with CLI tools

DIAGNOSTICS
===========

attempted to contact: ['rabbit@openEuler-riscv64']

rabbit@openEuler-riscv64:
  * connected to epmd (port 4369) on openEuler-riscv64
  * epmd reports node 'rabbit' uses port 25672 for inter-node and CLI tool traffic 
  * can't establish TCP connection to the target node, reason: timeout (timed out)
  * suggestion: check if host 'openEuler-riscv64' resolves, is reachable and ports 25672, 4369 are not blocked by firewall

Current node details:
 * node name: 'rabbitmqcli-22-rabbit@openEuler-riscv64'
 * effective user's home directory: /var/lib/rabbitmq
 * Erlang cookie hash: u6MAeSSgfsulGYYiuSLKYA==

  * connected to epmd (port 4369) on openEuler-riscv64
  * epmd reports node 'rabbit' uses port 25672 for inter-node and CLI tool traffic 
  * TCP connection succeeded but Erlang distribution failed 
  * suggestion: check if the Erlang cookie is identical for all server nodes and CLI tools
  * suggestion: check if all server nodes and CLI tools use consistent hostnames when addressing each other
  * suggestion: check if inter-node connections may be configured to use TLS. If so, all nodes and CLI tools must do that
   * suggestion: see the CLI, clustering and networking guides on https://rabbitmq.com/documentation.html to learn more

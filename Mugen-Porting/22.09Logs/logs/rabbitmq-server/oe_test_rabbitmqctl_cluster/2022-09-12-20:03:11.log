Stopping rabbit application on node rabbit@rabbitmq1 ...
Error: unable to perform an operation on node 'rabbit@rabbitmq2'. Please see diagnostics information and suggestions below.

Most common reasons for this are:

 * Target node is unreachable (e.g. due to hostname resolution, TCP connection or firewall issues)
 * CLI tool fails to authenticate with the server (e.g. due to CLI tool's Erlang cookie not matching that of the server)
 * Target node is not running

In addition to the diagnostics info below:

 * See the CLI, clustering and networking guides on https://rabbitmq.com/documentation.html to learn more
 * Consult server logs on node rabbit@rabbitmq2
 * If target node is configured to use long node names, don't forget to use --longnames with CLI tools

DIAGNOSTICS

rabbit@rabbitmq2:
  * connected to epmd (port 4369) on rabbitmq2
  * epmd reports node 'rabbit' uses port 25672 for inter-node and CLI tool traffic 
  * can't establish TCP connection to the target node, reason: nxdomain (non-existing domain)
  * suggestion: check if host 'rabbitmq2' resolves, is reachable and ports 25672, 4369 are not blocked by firewall
